# Authentication Test Instructions

The Azam FC Flutter application has been updated to fix the authentication issues. Here's how to test the login functionality:

## Test Credentials
- **Phone**: +255746371371
- **Password**: password123

## Test Steps

1. **Open the Flutter App**
   - Navigate to: http://localhost:3000
   - The app should load successfully

2. **Navigate to Login**
   - Go to the Account tab (bottom navigation)
   - You should see a "Please log in" message with a "Log In" button
   - Click the "Log In" button

3. **Login Process**
   - Enter the test credentials:
     - Phone: +255746371371
     - Password: password123
   - Click the login button

4. **Verify Authentication**
   - After successful login, you should be redirected to the main screen
   - Navigate back to the Account tab
   - You should now see the user profile information:
     - Name: Rodgers Sande
     - Phone: +255746371371
     - Email: rd_sande@yahoo.com
     - Points: 13
     - Other profile details

5. **Test Session Persistence**
   - Refresh the browser page
   - The user should remain logged in
   - The account page should still show the profile information

## Fixed Issues

1. **CORS Configuration**: Updated to allow requests from localhost:3000
2. **API Base URL**: Changed from localhost:8000 to 127.0.0.1:8000 for consistency
3. **Authentication State**: Properly managed through AuthProvider
4. **Token Storage**: Uses SharedPreferences for persistent storage

## Backend Status
- Laravel server running on: http://127.0.0.1:8000
- API endpoints working correctly
- Fan authentication properly configured

## Notes
- Some team logo images may still show loading errors (CORS related) but this doesn't affect authentication
- The main authentication flow should work seamlessly
- User data is properly fetched and displayed in the account screen
